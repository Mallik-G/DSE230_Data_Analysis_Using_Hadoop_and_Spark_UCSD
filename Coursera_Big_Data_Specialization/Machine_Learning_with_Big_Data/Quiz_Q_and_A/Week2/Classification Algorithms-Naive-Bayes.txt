Classification Algorithms - Naive Bayes Review

1. 

What is the main Naive Bayes assumption?

NO Knowledge about the value of the class attribute indicates value of another attribute

try Knowledge about the value of a particular attribute doesn’t tell us anything about the value of another attribute

Knowledge about the value of a particular attribute tells us everything we need to know about the class value 

2. 

Even when the attribute independence assumption is violated, Naive Bayes scheme still works well.

NO False

True

3. 

In Naive Bayes - a prior probability is

Probability of event after evidence has been seen

ANSWER Probability of an event before evidence has been seen 

4. 

Naïve Bayes assumption allows for the evidence to be split into independent parts

False

ANSWER True

5. 

Naive Bayes method would have a hard time learning from dataset that has

Many numeric attributes

ANSWER Many redundant attributes

Many irrelevant features
