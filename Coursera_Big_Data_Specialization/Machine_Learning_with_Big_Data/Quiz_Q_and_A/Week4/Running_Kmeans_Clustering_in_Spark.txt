Running Kmeans Clustering in Spark

1. 
After running the Kmeans pyspark script, with the number of clusters k=3: What is the SSE?


1.96

4.54

answer 2.03

2. 
Change the number of clusters to k=4 and rerun the training command and get the SSE (or rerun the whole script).

What is the approximate SSE for k=4?

(note that the random data is generated with seed values set so it should be the same across runs)


answer 1.65

4.96

1.50

3. 
What is the relationship between SSE when k=1 and the variance of each dimension?


NO SSE is not related to variance of each dimensin

SSE is 2 times the variance of each dimension

answer SSE = total variance of each dimension
